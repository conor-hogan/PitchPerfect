# PitchPerfect
iOS app that allows users to change their voice recordings.

This project was a part of Udacity's "iOS Developer Nanodegree course"

Primary learning objectives of this project are
* Creating a new project from existing iOS app templates
* Adding buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Leveraging the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Creating Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigating between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Playing audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Running the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
* Searching documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
